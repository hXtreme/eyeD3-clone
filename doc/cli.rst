``eyeD3`` Command Line Tool
===========================

The ``eyeD3`` command line interface is based on plugins. The main driver
knows how to traverse file systems and load audio files for handoff to the 
plugin to do something interesting. With no plugin selected the usage
documentation is::

  

.. code-block:: sh

  $ eyeD3 --help
